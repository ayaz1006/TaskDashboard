## Test User Credentials

## NOTE:
1. Register route somehow is not working on Netlify. You may run the frontend locally to view the same.
2. Frontend is hosted on Netlify and backend on Render.com.
3. Free tier version of render.com is user which sometimes causes a delay of few seconds in the first respone.
